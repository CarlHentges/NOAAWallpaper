# NOAAWallpaper
## Update (GNOME?) Wallpaper with latest synoptic weather chart from NOAA
To use, add a call to the scipt as a **crontab** (man crontab) with an apropreate interval, the noaa image is updated every 3h.
Optionaly you can also add the script to  **/etc/profile.d** which will run it on login.(not that the scirpt may throw errors and these may sometimes give problems when logging in).
